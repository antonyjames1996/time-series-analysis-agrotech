# time-series-analysis-agrotech

In this project we explore a private dataset given by my project supervisor with data on the lettuce crop. It is a time-series data with dates given of the planting, checking and flight dates. We are supposed to predict 3 features from the other features derived through the plant information and weather information.

We have currently used our data for pre-processing and exploratory data-analysis. We are now supposed to do some feature engineering and make ML models to predict the 3 features required. We need to explore how the different time-series data and the weather data can incorporated into training in the model.
